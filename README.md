### Usage


- Explain how to use the Shuffle Array program.
- Write Down the Original Array: Write down the elements of your array on a piece of paper in the order they currently appear.

Create an Empty List: Create an empty list on the paper next to the original array. This list will hold the shuffled elements.

Randomly Select and Move Elements: Close your eyes or look away, and with your pen or finger, randomly select an element from the original array. Write it down in the shuffled list. This ensures randomness.

Repeat Until Done: Repeat step 3 until you have moved all the elements from the original array to the shuffled list. Make sure not to pick the same element twice.

Your Shuffled Array is Ready: The shuffled list on your paper now contains the elements in a random order, creating a shuffled version of your original array.

That's it! You've manually shuffled an array without writing any code. This method is straightforward and can be fun, especially for smaller arrays. For larger arrays or when automation is necessary, using code is the way to go.
